# Changelog Convention

## Documentation Rules

- **Never** create markdown summary files in the project root after completing tasks
- **Never** create verbose implementation summaries or documentation unless explicitly requested
- Keep all task summaries minimal and concise

## Changelog Location

When a changelog is explicitly requested, create files in `changelogs/` directory with format:
- Filename: `YYYY-MM-DD-brief-description.md`
- Include date at the top of the file
- Keep content brief: what changed and why
- Focus on user-facing changes and breaking changes

## Response Style

After completing work:
- Provide a 1-2 sentence summary in chat
- Do not create documentation files unless requested
- Avoid bullet-point recaps of what was accomplished
